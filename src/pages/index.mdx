## Abstract

Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in audio understanding and generation. However, their reasoning processes remain opaque, and they often struggle with complex audio reasoning tasks that require multi-step analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce **Thinking-with-Sound (TwS)**, a novel framework that equips LALMs with audio-domain Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. TwS enables models to perform interleaved linguistic reasoning and on-the-fly acoustic analysis, leading to more robust and interpretable multimodal understanding. Our approach leverages a dual-stream architecture that processes both textual and acoustic features simultaneously, allowing the model to reason about audio content through natural language while maintaining access to low-level acoustic details. We evaluate TwS on a comprehensive suite of audio reasoning tasks, including audio question answering, audio summarization, and audio-based decision making. Experimental results demonstrate that TwS significantly improves performance on complex audio reasoning tasks, with particular gains on the challenging **MELD-Hard1k** benchmark. Furthermore, our **Audio CoT** approach provides interpretable reasoning traces that reveal how the model processes and understands audio content. The framework is generalizable across different LALM architectures and can be easily integrated into existing systems. Our work opens new directions for developing more capable and transparent audio-language models that can reason about sound in a human-like manner.
